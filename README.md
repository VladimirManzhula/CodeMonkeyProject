# CodeMonkeyProject

## Introduction
Hello everyone! I recently came across an interesting project on Code Monkey's YouTube channel, and I decided to recreate it using my knowledge of project architecture and the frameworks I typically work with. The original project was featured in a YouTube video. I really liked the approach they used, and I think this project can serve as a great example of my own code!

## Starting
Please start with the Splash scene, as the idea is that part of the data should be loaded in the intermediate scene.
